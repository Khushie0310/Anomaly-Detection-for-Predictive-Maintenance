# Anomaly Detection Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for **anomaly detection** using a dataset with various features. The goal is to predict anomalies in the data, evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, and make predictions on unseen data.

## Problem Statement
Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as fraud detection, network security, and predictive maintenance. In this project, we focus on detecting anomalies in a dataset by building a robust machine learning model capable of classifying instances as either **normal** or **anomalous**.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is called **AnomaData**, which contains several numerical features describing the characteristics of each instance. The dataset includes both **normal** and **anomalous** labels that the model needs to predict.

- **Features**: Various numerical features (e.g., sensor readings, metrics).
- **Target Variable**: A binary variable indicating whether the instance is **normal** or **anomalous**.

---

## Data Preprocessing
Several preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset to prepare it for training the model:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data was handled by either removing rows/columns or filling in the missing values.
- **Data Transformation**: Categorical variables were converted to numeric form, and numerical features were normalized for model compatibility.
- **Feature Selection**: Relevant features were selected based on exploratory analysis and importance scores from the model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand the dataset’s structure and identify patterns:
- **Feature Distributions**: Visualizations were created to explore the distributions of features.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Heatmaps and correlation matrices were used to investigate relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Key Insights**: Key features contributing to anomaly detection were identified during the analysis.

The visualizations can be found in the `images/` folder.

## Predictive Data Analysis

### 1. **Model Training**:
   The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset, and hyperparameters were tuned using appropriate methods to achieve optimal performance.

### 2. **Model Evaluation**:
   The model was evaluated using several important metrics:
   - **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.
   - **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
   - **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases.
   - **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   - **ROC-AUC**: The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, which shows the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

   The trained model demonstrated **high accuracy** and **reliable recall**, making it suitable for anomaly detection tasks.

### 3. **Making Predictions**:
   The trained model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The results are provided in a CSV file containing predictions and their corresponding probabilities.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of relevant predicted results.
- **Recall**: Measures how well the model identifies true positives.
- **F1-Score**: The balance between precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: Measures the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - The exploratory analysis revealed important insights into the relationships between features and the target variable. Visualizations like **distributions** and **correlation heatmaps** provided a clear understanding of the data and its structure.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - **XGBoost**, a gradient-boosting model, was selected for anomaly detection based on its effectiveness with structured/tabular data.
   - The model was trained on the preprocessed data, and hyperparameters were tuned for optimal performance.
   - The model's performance was evaluated using key metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC**. It achieved strong performance, with **high accuracy** and **good recall**, making it suitable for identifying anomalies.

4. **Making Predictions**:
   - After training the model, predictions were made on new, unseen data using the trained model. The results were saved in a CSV file, which includes both the predicted labels and the associated probabilities for each instance.

### Contributions of the Project:
- The project successfully developed an **anomaly detection model** that can distinguish between normal and anomalous instances.
- The model demonstrated strong predictive performance, making it a reliable tool for anomaly detection tasks in real-world applications, such as fraud detection, network security, or predictive maintenance.

### Future Work:
- **Experimenting with other algorithms**: Future experiments could involve testing other algorithms like **Random Forest**, **Isolation Forest**, or **Autoencoders**, which are also effective for anomaly detection tasks.
- **Improving the model**: Hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering can further improve the model's performance.
- **Deployment**: The trained model can be deployed in real-world applications, where it can be used for **real-time anomaly detection** using frameworks like **Flask** or **FastAPI**.

### Final Thoughts:
This project has successfully achieved its objective of detecting anomalies in the dataset with high accuracy and reliability. The **XGBoost model** proved to be an effective tool for this task, and the results demonstrate its applicability to real-world anomaly detection problems. Future work can focus on improving the model’s robustness, exploring other algorithms, and deploying the solution for practical use cases.
