Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Sensor Data

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for anomaly detection in time-series sensor data from industrial machinery. The goal is to identify anomalous readings in the sensor data, which can be indicative of machinery malfunctions or failures. Early detection of these anomalies can help in predictive maintenance, reducing downtime, improving operational efficiency, and saving costs associated with unexpected breakdowns.

Problem Statement
In industrial settings, sensor data from machinery is continuously collected. However, over time, some of this data may become irregular, indicating potential issues such as mechanical failure or inefficiencies. The problem is to automatically detect these anomalies in real-time or from historical data, which could signal the need for maintenance. Accurate anomaly detection can prevent costly breakdowns, improve safety, and optimize machine performance.

Problem Structure
The problem is a binary classification task, where the target variable (y) indicates whether a sensor reading is normal (0) or anomalous (1). The sensor readings are captured as multiple features (x1, x2, ..., x60), each representing a specific metric from the machinery. The key challenge is to build a model that can distinguish between normal and anomalous data points based on these features.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, converting datetime columns, and scaling features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset through visualizations and identify key patterns, outliers, and relationships between features.
Modeling: Use machine learning algorithms to train models for anomaly detection.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset
The dataset consists of 10,000 rows and 60 features. Each row corresponds to sensor data from machinery at a particular timestamp. The features (x1, x2, ..., x60) represent sensor readings, while the target variable y indicates whether the reading is normal (0) or anomalous (1).

Features:
x1, x2, ..., x60: Sensor readings from different machinery metrics.
y: Target variable (0 = normal, 1 = anomaly).
The dataset is designed to simulate real-world sensor data, where anomalies are sparse and can vary depending on machine conditions.

Modeling Techniques
The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in sensor data:

Logistic Regression:

A simple and interpretable model used as a baseline for comparison.
Random Forest:
A tree-based ensemble model that handles non-linear data well and is robust to overfitting.
XGBoost:
An advanced gradient boosting technique that is highly effective for structured/tabular data. XGBoost is used with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV to find the optimal model configuration.
Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.

Precision: The percentage of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
Recall: The percentage of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of model performance.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix used to visualize the performance of the classification model.
The XGBoost model was selected as the final model because it showed superior performance in terms of recall and F1-score, making it well-suited for anomaly detection tasks where false negatives (missed anomalies) are critical to avoid.

Conclusion:

The anomaly detection model developed in this project successfully identifies anomalous sensor readings from machinery data. By using machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, we were able to achieve high accuracy and recall, making the model effective for real-time predictive maintenance applications. This can help industrial companies avoid costly breakdowns and optimize their operations.

Key Findings:

XGBoost performed better than Logistic Regression and Random Forest, achieving higher recall and F1-score.
The model was able to identify anomalies with a high degree of accuracy, using features like x1, x2, and x60 that were strongly correlated with the target variable y.

Future Work:

Model Deployment:Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or FastAPI for real-time anomaly detection.

Advanced Model Interpretability:Further enhance model interpretability using advanced techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to provide additional insights into feature importance.

Real-Time Anomaly Detection:Integrate the trained model into a real-time monitoring system for continuous anomaly detection as new data comes in.

Additional Feature Engineering:Explore additional features such as time-series analysis (e.g., rolling averages) to further improve the model's performance.

Model Performance Improvement:Experiment with more advanced models like Deep Learning or Autoencoders to improve anomaly detection in more complex datasets.
